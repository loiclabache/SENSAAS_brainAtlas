## Background

32 multimodal areas of sentence processing activated and leftward
asymmetrical during sentence production, reading and listening were
identified by comparison with a reference task (word list production,
reading and listening). The temporal correlations at rest between these
32 regions made it possible to detect their belonging to 3 networks.
**Among these networks, one, including 18 regions, contains the
essential language areas (*SENT_CORE* network)**, *i.e.* those whose
lesion would cause an alteration in the understanding of speech.
